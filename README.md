# ml-bulldozer-price-prediction

### This is a machine learning project on the Kaggle bluebook bulldozer price prediction dataset. Here I have used **Random Forest Regression** model on the data set.
After using **RandomizedSearchCV** on the Random Forest Regression model we found suitable hyperparameters to find a proper model to fit test data and predict bulldozer prices.
I have used the following approach in the process:
* Problem Definition 
* Data Collection and Analysis 
* Evaluation 
* Feature Analysis 
* Modelling and 
* Experimentation

Language and Libraries used:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Numpy
5. Scikit-learn
